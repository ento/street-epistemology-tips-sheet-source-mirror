# SE tips poster source text

This is a 'mirror' of the Street Epistemology tips sheet found in the public Googld Drive folder linked to from streetepistemology.com's [Resources](https://streetepistemology.com/resources/) page.

This repo only contains the plaintext strings, so that it's easier to compare different versions. The purpose is primarily for aiding with translation.
