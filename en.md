Street Epistemology (SE) is a conversational tool that helps people reflect on the quality and reliability of their reasoning in a non-confrontational manner. Here are some steps that may help you through a conversation. Don’t feel obligated to use all of these simultaneously. Pace yourself and try to go where your conversation partner takes you!

## 1. Choosing the topic, obtaining consent, introducing SE
- What would you say is your claim?
- Do you mind if I ask you some questions about it?
- I’m really interested in examining your belief and the ways of reasoning behind it.
- One goal is to understand your reasoning and reflect on its reliability together.
- I'll be happy to answer the same questions myself as well if you're interested.
- The approach I'd like to use in this conversation is called Street Epistemology. It's aimed at examining the methods we use to come to conclusions.

## 2. Clarification of the belief. The “What” type of questions
- What do you mean by that?
- Could you please elaborate on that, so that I can better understand it?
- Can you please give me your best example of how that works?

### In case the belief is ethical:
- Do you think anything should be done about it?
- What kind of results do you expect to see?
- So you believe that these [particular] actions would result in those [testable] consequences?
- What are the pros and cons of this solution?

### Testing for the interest in examining the belief:
- How important do you find this subject?
- Do you think that people who disagree with you are wrong?
- If your belief was faulty in some way would you like to know about it?

## 3. Finding the level of confidence
- How confident are you in this belief?
- On a scale from 0 to 100% how confident are you that your [particular] belief is correct?

## 4. Searching for the confidence reasons. The “Why” questions
- Why do you think so?
- What gives you that amount of confidence?
- What would you say is the main reason for that confidence?
- If you didn’t have that [particular reason] how would that impact your confidence?
- If we put all your reasons on a pie chart how big of a slice would each reason get?

## 5. Examining the reliability of the methods. The “How” questions
### Socratic questioning:
- Should this [particular] evidence give us that amount of confidence?
- Would the same reasoning work with different claims?
- Can our feelings be deceptive?
- Can a person have faith in something that is not true?
- How can we determine if two separate events are related in any way?
- How could we test this?

### Searching for alternative explanations:
- What alternative explanations can you think of?
- Is there a way to know which alternative explanation is the most plausible?
- If there were other possible explanations would you like to know them?

### Making the claim falsifiable:
- How could we test whether it is really true?
- Is there a possibility that you are mistaken about it?
- What could possibly show you that you were mistaken if that was the case?
- What new evidence would significantly shift your confidence about it?

### The outsider test:
- If another person uses the same [particular] methods and comes to a different conclusion than you do, how could an outside observer decide which one of your claims is more likely to be correct?
- If some methods can lead us to different and contradictory conclusions what does it tell us about the reliability of such methods?

- What question do you think would be important to ask next?
- What would be a good question to ask yourself?

## 6. Feedback and reflection
- Did our chat generate any interesting thoughts?
- Did your level of confidence fluctuate in any way afterwards?
- Did you enjoy our conversation?

## 7. Concluding the conversation
- SE talks can absolutely be a back and forth exchange. Ask if they would like to use these questions with you, or maybe to just learn your stance on the same subject.
- Exchanging contacts and information.
- Thank you for the chat!
